Run Instructions:

1. place input file(s) in same directory as CPSC433AI.jar

There are 2 run modes (Normal and TIMEOUT)
- Normal: runs the search normally until tree is fully processed.
- TIMEOUT: runs the search upto the inputted maximum runtime. Useful for large files.
    timeout mode will create a log.txt in same directory that will have more optimal solutions appended to it as they are found. There will also be a print on the command-line to indicate when a better solution is found.

Usage: java -jar CPSC433AI.jar <input file> <output file> <pen_coursemin> <pen_labsmin> <pen_notpaired> <pen_section> <w_minfilled> <w_pref> <w_pair> <w_secdiff>
